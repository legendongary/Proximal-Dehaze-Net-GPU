function optimizeVars(net, opts, objs)
%OPTIMIZEVARS
%   Variable allocation optimizations, such as ReLU short-circuiting.
%   Called by COMPILE.
%
%   Assumes BUILDORDER was called, deciding the execution order (OBJS
%   contains the ordered layers), and assigning all needed output vars
%   (OBJS{K}.OUTPUTVAR). This function can change the assigned output vars.

  % Short-circuiting a ReLU amounts to setting the outputVar to be the same
  % as the input var. The corresponding derivative also gets reused. This
  % requires that the result of the backward ReLU *replace* the derivative,
  % not be accumulated as usual (layer.accumDer = false).
  %
  % It cannot be done when:
  % 1) The same input var is used by other layers.
  % 2) The input is a Param; otherwise the value and its derivative would
  %    get overwritten. It would also cause trouble with sub-batches
  %    (Param derivative accumulation).
  %
  % An alternative in case 1 would be to delete the output var after it is
  % used by the next layers, but this is not implemented currently.
